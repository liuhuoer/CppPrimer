　　I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up 
and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these 
truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal."
　　I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia
the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowner
-s will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.
　　I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississip
-pi, a desert state, sweltering with the heat of injustice 
and oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of 
freedom and justice.
　　I have a dream that my four children will one day live 
in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of 
their skin but by the content of their character.
